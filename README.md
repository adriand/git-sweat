Minimal Fitness App
===================

Requirements
------------

2. Local storage of progress
3. Easy syntax for writing new exercise programs
4. Handle:
  a) Reps
  b) Time
  c) Quotes
  d) Pics
5. Shows progress
6. Shows total time

Setup
-----

Due to the somewhat broken nature of cross-domain policies, you'll need to use a web server to run this.  Just place the
directory in a publicly accessible location and navigate to index.htm.

To-do
-----

Simplified Markdown for the exercise programs?
